# lets-day-off

lets-day-off or Let's have days off is intended to be a program to help you pick some days off your work. If you've experienced that picking some day off is hard and eventually forgot to use the quota and the company won't top-up your quota in the upcoming year. That is sad, right? So, let's have some days off!

# How is it work?

At initial state, this program can only randomly pick some days for you to makr on your calendar. You can also choose to or not to pick Weekends to the list. Moreover, you can assign which days you've already marked on your calendar.

# Can it be more fansy?

YES! I'd like to see it too. You can contribute a day picking function to this repo by yourself! Feel free to try it since I've prepare basic setup and structure for you to just add another function to pick the day. I hope to see some of your magic tricks.
